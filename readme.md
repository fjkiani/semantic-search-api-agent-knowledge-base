# Semantic Search API with AI Agents & Knowledge Base

## Overview
An advanced semantic search system that combines vector search, graph databases, and AI agents to provide intelligent legal document search and analysis capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Services
- **Vector Store (Qdrant)**: For semantic similarity search
- **Graph Database (Neo4j)**: For relationship mapping and traversal
- **Object Storage (MinIO)**: For document storage
- **AI Services (Cohere)**: For embeddings, reasoning, and reranking

### Key Components

1. **Orchestrator Service**
   - Coordinates between different services
   - Handles document processing pipeline
   - Manages search operations

2. **Storage Services**
   - `QdrantService`: Vector embeddings storage
   - `Neo4jService`: Knowledge graph management
   - `MinioService`: Document object storage

3. **Processing Services**
   - `LlamaIndexService`: Document indexing
   - `DocumentProcessor`: File handling and extraction

4. **AI Services**
   - `CohereService`: Embeddings & reasoning
   - Research Agent
   - Analysis Agent
   - Review Agent
   - Precedent Agent
